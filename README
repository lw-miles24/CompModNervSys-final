==================================
MODEL OVERVIEW
ballandstick.py creates a simplified ball-and-stick model of a pyramidal neuron with tapering dendrites. the morphology consists of:
- 1 soma
- 1 apical dendrite with 2 apical tuft subcomponents
- 2 basal dendrites
- 1 axon, which can be attached to either the soma or to one of the basal dendrites

EXPERIMENT FILES
simulate_BallAndStick_didfire_Vm_soma.ipynb (finalized 5/31/2024)
- compares firing of somatic AIS vs. dendritic AIS (mean distance found in Hodapp et al. 2022)
- uses scaling inputs from excitatory synapse (0 - 0.12 µS) and inhibitory synapse (0 - 0.08 µS)
- outputs successful firings (as reported by Vm > 0 mV in AIS) to heatmap: x = inhibitory weight; y = excitatory weight; color = somatic Vm
